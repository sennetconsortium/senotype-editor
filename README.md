This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Working with submodule

This repository relies on the [search-ui](https://github.com/dbmi-pitt/search-ui) as a submodule to function. The
file `.gitmodules` contains the configuration for the URL and specific branch of the submodule that is to be used. Once
you already have cloned this repository and switched to the target branch, to load the latest `search-ui` submodule:

```
git submodule update --init --remote
```
